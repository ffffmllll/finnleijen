	<p><i>The laces of fate loosen as we journey through our fields.</i></p>
	<p><i>We trudge through heavy soil, face blinding storms, seek shelter from scorching suns.</i></p>
	<p><i>Our illustrations are drawn from the steps we take,</i></p>
	<p><i>As if we were the artists of our own fate.</i></p>
	<p><i>Like seasons passed, storms are cleared, trees regrown;</i></p>
	<p><i>Our footprints remain within memories, nature, love</i></p>

<p>This shoe was made in collaboraion with Schoenenkwartier Waalwijk, and <a href="https://schoenenkwartier.nl/en/podium-schoenenlab-editie-2023/">will be exhibited there until the first of april 2024</a>, after which it has been selected to go into their permanent collection, however will probably end up in their archive for a while. If you want to see it in person, ask them... not me.</p>
<p>The shoe was inspired by pin culture, and how pins are used in punk/emo DIY culture. The shoe has an outer and an inner layer around which you can create a collage. The outer layer is made from transparent ECCO leather which was provided to me by the museum.</p>
