	<p>‘Everything that happened when no one was looking.’ is a collection of videos exploring the realities and specifics of being alone, and ways to be alone without it being a detriment to daily life. The film provides record of experiments that attempt to deconstruct the lines between loneliness and alone time, and to build habits that lead to a fulfilling time. It is explored through the lens of proxemics, differentiating public, social, private, and intimate space, in relation to being alone.</p>
	<p>In a society where everyone is moving further apart constantly, loneliness seeps into many parts of daily life. The films attempt to find the core and the meaning of humans isolating themselves, and how that can be experienced differently by different people in order to find ways to live with loneliness, instead of fleeing it.</p>
	<p>The films use long drawn out, silent shots to convey the sensation of being an observer, instead of participatory in any situation. The films become proxemically more intimate over the course of time, by how the shots zoom in and out, aloneness is explored as something that’s in even the biggest spaces, to something close to us.</p>
