	<p>‘Everything that happened when no one was looking.’ is a 1 hour long documentary project created over the course of 4 months. The video work is a documentation of trying to confront being alone by endulging as much as possible. The video is recorded entirely on a single miniDV tape, and takes up the whole 1 hour, no post-processing or editing, only re-recording sections. The video includes travelling to Eemshaven, the most isolated town in the country I could reach, and interviews as well as my own personal accounts of things that took place while being alone, and due to being alone.</p>
