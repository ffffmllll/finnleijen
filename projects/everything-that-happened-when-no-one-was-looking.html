	<p>‘Everything that happened when no one was looking.’ is a video diary/archive recorded over the span of one semester which provides record of a personal journey through aloneness/loneliness.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>The film is entirely recorded on a single 1 hour miniDV tape. The front to the back is completely unedited, and the only way to curate the order of the videos is to record over certain parts and skip moments in time on the tape.</p>
	<p>The video presents both book-smart research as well as embodied research through organised chapters and 'social experiments'. I attempt to have dinner, go to the movies, and a concert alone, travel down to (and document) the loneliest place in the country I can reach on my own (Eemshaven) and try to present my experiences, thoughts and emotions through film. </p>
	<p><i>the work is very personal to me, if you want to see it, or parts of it, please contact me on my instagram page.</i></p>
