<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tulou (</span><span class="s2">土</span><span class="s3">楼</span><span class="s1">) are communal living spaces used by the Hakka people in southern China (Fujian province), a Tulou is a round or rectangular building with an open courtyard in the middle. The buildings often have a shrine in the middle of the courtyard and are relatively closed off to the outside. The Hakka people traditionally built walled off structures, so it is easily defended in conflict. Tulou were mainly built from the 12th century until the 20th century. They can house up to 800 people, and often act like micro-cities with communities that take care of each-other.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The communal function of these buildings is highlighted through architectural techniques which create a shared space. The courtyard inside is very easy to watch, which makes it safer for children to be outside, and it can also be a place for people to meet up. There are often shops and restaurants in the bottom floors which are run by the people of the Tulou and serve the people living there as well. The houses have a door on each floor, and are only one room wide, which means a lot of people can live in a single Tulou.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The shelter from the outside is not only an architectural function of the Tulou. The people inside the Tulou do not need to make contact with people from outside to sustain themselves. A Tulou is really a closed system which focuses mainly on subsistence. A possible reason why these Tulou did not catch on to be the new primary housing type is because of this. Modern society is very focused on growth, we have organized large systems which let everyone play a role in society to maximize efficiency and improve living standards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
